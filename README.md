# Learning-Java-Maps

A map is a collection of key-value pairs, essentially a look-up table. In this example we create a map of employee names (keys - strings) to their employee id numbers (values - integers). Hashmap is a type of map that is most commonly used based on its underlying functionality. The two types we're using for key and value type have to be java classes (e.g. Integer, Double) and not primitive lower-case types (e.g. int, double).
